"""world_import.py -- build a world's game data from the SWOS 96/97 Mod's
(docs/WORLD_2026_27.md, phase 3).

    python3 -I scripts/world_import.py              # World 2026-27 -> bin/data_json/worlds/2627/

Reads the Mod's data as Davide Lorigliola sent it (bin/data_json/worlds/2627/mod/: his
teams in OpenSWOS team JSON, his packs) and writes what the game reads for that world:

    bin/data_json/worlds/2627/teams/ITALY.json        the country's team file, our format
    bin/data_json/worlds/2627/competitions/leagues.json  the league records that differ
                                                        from 96/97, by id (an overlay:
                                                        src/save_format_json.c)

Phase 3 is the first world inside today's limits, so it is ONE country in 96/97's shape:
Italy's 51 slots hold Serie A (20, league 0), Serie B (20, league 1) and 11 Serie C clubs
outside the league (league 4), as 96/97's 51 hold A 18, B 20 and 13 others. Every other
country stays 96/97's (the overlay falls back to it).

What our engine cannot show yet is mapped, and counted on the way:
  - 16 players a team (the Mod's extra 14 are left out);
  - kit colour 10 (purple) -> 6 (maroon: the palette entry the Mod borrows for it);
  - face 3 (black skin, blond hair) -> 2;
  - nationalities the game has no name for (153 on) -> the club's country's;
  - shirt numbers above 16 (the game draws 1..16) -> the free ones of 1..16.

Ids: every team and player gets its uuid here, CANONICAL for netplay (docs/TEAM_IDS.md):
uuid5 in the database's namespace of "2627/team/<club id>" and ".../player/<index>" --
the Mod's club id (club:ita.<press name>), so a club keeps its id whatever its file or
place -- and the checksum of what a match plays it by, as scripts/assign_team_uuids.py
computes it. The data is not to be published yet: bin/data_json/worlds/ is ignored.
